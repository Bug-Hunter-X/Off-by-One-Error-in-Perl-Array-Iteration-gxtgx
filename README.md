This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a common off-by-one error during array iteration. The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version. The error arises from using `$#array` which gives the last index, rather than the array's length.  The solution demonstrates the proper iteration using the `@array` directly in the loop.
